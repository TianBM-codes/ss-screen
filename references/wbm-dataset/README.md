# WBM preparation

WBM entry reconciliation, metadata validation, extxyz conversion, and condensation helpers.

**Current package coverage:** Extxyz consumption is migrated; raw entry/summary reconciliation remains partial.

**Historical cautions:** The full WBM dataset remains external; historical scripts rely on fixed clean/dirty boundaries.

Notebook outputs and execution state are preserved. External datasets and calculation artifacts referenced by these files are not included.
