# Historical upstream references

These files preserve read-only research provenance. They are not canonical package code and must not be executed as a workflow without review.

Snapshot: `2026-07-21`. Stored: 78; redacted: 2; aliases: 35; excluded: 101.

Large datasets, calculation directories, archives, `.aiida` data, generated scheduler artifacts, and secrets remain external.
